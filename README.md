# Maps for Hong Kong District Election 2019

Choropleth map is frequently used to reveal geographic pattern of election result, e.g. [立場區議會選舉專頁 (2015)](https://dce2015.thestandnews.com/). Such presentation usually raises a problem: each constitutency is of equally important in term of parlimentary seat, but those with larger area are displayed inproportionally large that tends to mislead readers when the primary interest is the number or proportion of seats won by each party.

To address this issue, some suggest using [cartogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram). Inspired by the [Tilegrams Project](https://medium.com/google-news-lab/tilegrams-make-your-own-cartogram-hexmaps-with-our-new-tool-df46894eeec1), this project is set up to generate the hexgrid cartogram for the upcoming HK District Council Election 2019.

We noted that [g0vhk](https://g0vhk.io/) has set up their own [hexgrid map project](https://github.com/cswbrian/district-councils-dashboard) with slightly different approach, which focuses on the district original position on a Hong Kong map.
